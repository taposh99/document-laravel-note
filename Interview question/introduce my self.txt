Good [morning/afternoon], and thank you for giving me this opportunity.

My name is Saniatul Haque, and I’m a passionate Software Engineer with over three years of experience in full-stack web development, mainly using PHP and the Laravel framework.

I’ve worked on a wide range of applications including Inventory Management Systems, E-commerce platforms, Procurement Management, and custom ERP modules. I’m comfortable working on both frontend and backend, and I always focus on writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

I’m currently working at Multibrand Infotech Ltd., where I contribute to developing and maintaining web applications, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, and applying performance optimization and debugging techniques.

I have hands-on experience with technologies like Laravel, Yii, React.js, MySQL, SQL Server, and tools like Git, Postman, Composer, and cPanel.

I'm always eager to learn new things and improve my skills. My goal is to grow as a developer while delivering real value to the company I work with.

Outside of work, I also maintain a portfolio of my projects at saniatulhaque.com, and I actively contribute to GitHub.
